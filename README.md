Hello, I am building an android app using java and xml, it is an educational app that helps the user learn Mobile App Development topics like linearlayouts, buttons, and text views.
In these lessons there are quizes that the user can take that grant them progress points. these points will rank the user in a leaderboard based on the points they got so far.
There is a login and register feature that lets the user save their info like username and password along with their points and a remember me button for easier login.
The user also can change thier info in the profile section after verifying the password.
